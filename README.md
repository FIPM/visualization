# Project:
A language barrier to human capital development: are students in third grade facing a language barrier in the Guatemalan education system?

## Problem:
High dropout rate for indigenous students in Guatemala.

## Solution:
A webpage where decision-makers can visualize the influence of language on students' grade progression. The Ministry of Education of Guatemala will be able to design and institutionalize programs, based on data, specifically targeted at students at risk.

## Technical details:
- By using data analysis, I identify the variables affecting grade progression.

- By using statistics, I disaggregate the influence of language on grade progression.

- By using cloud platforms, I create a webpage to inform decision makers.

## Key technologies:
Pandas, Plotly, Flask, HTML, CSS, JS, Heroku.
